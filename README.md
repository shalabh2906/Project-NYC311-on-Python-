# Project-NYC311-on-Python-
Data Science for Python
After learning about Data Science in depth, it is now time to implement the knowledge gained through this course in real-life scenarios. We will provide you with four scenarios where you need to implement data science solutions. To perform these tasks, you can use the different Python libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, BeautifulSoup, and so on.  
 Perform a service request data analysis of New York City 311 calls. You will focus on the data wrangling techniques to understand the pattern in the data and also visualize the major complaint types. 
	Import a 311 NYC service request

o	Explore data
o	Find patterns
o	Display the complaint type and city together
	Find major complaint types
o	Find the top 10 complaint types 
o	Plot a bar graph of count vs. complaint types
	Visualize the complaint types
o	Display the major complaint types and their count
